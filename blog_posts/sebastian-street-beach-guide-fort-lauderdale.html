    <h3 class="gom-blog__h3">Where is the Gay Beach?</h3>
    <p>In Fort Lauderdale, the rainbow flag flies highest at <strong>Sebastian Street Beach</strong>. Located where Sebastian Street meets A1A, it’s easily recognizable by the concentration of gay men and the supportive, inclusive atmosphere. You’ll know you’re in the right place when you see the Sebastian St. lifeguard tower.</p>

  <section id="getting-there" class="gom-blog__section">
    <h3 class="gom-blog__h3">Getting There from Wilton Manors</h3>
    <p>Staying at Garden of Manors puts you in an ideal spot—close to the nightlife, but just a quick hop to the ocean.</p>
    <ul class="gom-blog__list">
      <li><strong>Uber/Lyft (Recommended):</strong> It’s the stress-free option. An Uber from our guesthouse typically costs around <strong>$12-$15</strong> and takes about 10-15 minutes depending on A1A traffic. You avoid the headache of finding parking.</li>
      <li><strong>Driving & Parking:</strong> If you drive, go early. Parking meters along A1A fill up by 10 AM on weekends. There is a public lot near Sebastian St, but it’s competitive.</li>
      <li><strong>Water Taxi:</strong> For a scenic route, you can catch the Water Taxi at <strong>Shooters Waterfront (Stop F10)</strong>, a short ride from the guesthouse. It won't drop you directly at Sebastian St (you'll need to walk or grab a calm trolley/Uber from the nearest beach stop), but it’s a fun day-trip experience.</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="amenities" class="gom-blog__section">
    <h3 class="gom-blog__h3">Amenities & What to Bring</h3>
    <p>Pack light, because you can rent what you need right on the sand.</p>
    <ul class="gom-blog__list">
      <li><strong>Chair Rentals:</strong> Look for the vendors (often "Boucher Brothers" or similar) on the beach. A set of 2 chairs and an umbrella typically runs around <strong>$60 for the day</strong>. Single chairs are often available for ~$22.</li>
      <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> There are water fountains near the entrance, but we recommend bringing a cooler. Note: Glass is strictly prohibited on the beach.</li>
      <li><strong>Shade:</strong> It gets hot. If you don't rent an umbrella, bring plenty of sunscreen.</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="nearby" class="gom-blog__section">
    <h3 class="gom-blog__h3">Nearby Eats</h3>
    <p>Hungry after a swim? You don’t have to go far.</p>
    <ul class="gom-blog__list">
      <li><strong>Casablanca Café:</strong> A historic home turned restaurant right on the beach. Great for a sit-down lunch with ocean views.</li>
      <li><strong>Beach Bars:</strong> Walk north or south along the promenade to find casual spots for a burger and beer.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="clothing" class="gom-blog__section">
    <h3 class="gom-blog__h3">Is it Clothing Optional?</h3>
    <p><strong>No.</strong> Sebastian Street Beach is a public, family-friendly beach where swimsuits are mandatory. If you’re looking for a total tan (no tan lines), you have two great options:</p>
    <ol class="gom-blog__list">
      <li><strong>Haulover Beach:</strong> Florida's official nude beach, about a 30-40 minute drive south.</li>
      <li><strong>Garden of Manors:</strong> Our pool and lounge areas are <strong>clothing-optional</strong>. You can enjoy the sun au naturel right here at your home base without traveling anywhere.</li>
    </ol>
