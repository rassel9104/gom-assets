    <h3 class="gom-blog__h3">From Guests to Hosts</h3>
    <p>Our adventure began with a love for travel. We knew exactly what we looked for in accommodation: privacy, impeccable cleanliness, and that special "something" that makes you feel cared for. Garden of Manors is the culmination of all our favorite experiences around the world, brought to our corner of Florida.</p>

    <h3 class="gom-blog__h3">The Value of Details</h3>
    <p>We are not a faceless corporation. We live here, we love this place, and we want you to love it too. That means real restaurant recommendations (no tourist traps), help when you need it, and of course, a safe and welcoming environment.</p>

    <p>One of our favorite moments is sharing a morning coffee or an afternoon drink with our guests, swapping stories and laughs. It is that warmth that transforms a common vacation into a memorable experience.</p>
