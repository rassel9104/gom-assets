    <p>Surrounded by the forks of the Middle River, Wilton Manors is an unsuspecting paradise for water lovers. Renting a kayak or paddleboard is one of the best ways to see the local architecture and wildlife (herons, iguanas, and manatees) from a different perspective.</p>

    <h3 class="gom-blog__h3">The Brunch Culture</h3>
    <p>In our community, brunch isn't just a meal, it's a ritual. From bottomless mimosas to gourmet eggs benedict, Sundays (and Saturdays) are reserved for recovery and reconnection.</p>

    <p>On the third Saturday of every month, the <strong>Art Walk</strong> transforms the Drive into an open-air gallery. But even on a normal day, you can find hidden treasures in antique shops and design boutiques that are unique to our area.</p>

    <p>After a day of exploring, returning to the tranquility of <strong>Garden of Manors</strong> is the perfect closure. A dip in the pool before getting ready for the night is the quintessential routine of the honorary Wilton Manors resident.</p>
