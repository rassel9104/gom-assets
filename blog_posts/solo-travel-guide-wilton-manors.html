    <h3 class="gom-blog__h3">Why Wilton Manors is Perfect for Solo Travelers</h3>
    <p>Traveling alone can be daunting, but Wilton Manors is arguably one of the easiest places in the world to be a solo gay traveler. It’s not just the density of LGBTQ+ businesses; it’s the culture. "The Island City" is a walkable village where you’re more likely to be adopted by a group of locals at a happy hour than to sit alone staring at your phone.</p>
    <p>Unlike massive cities where you can get lost in the crowd, Wilton Drive offers a condensed, friendly strip where seeing familiar faces happens within hours of arrival. Whether you're here to make new friends or just enjoy some unbothered "me time" by the pool, the vibe is yours to curate.</p>

    <h3 class="gom-blog__h3">Where to Socialize (Without It Being Awkward)</h3>
    <p>Walking into a bar alone? No stress. We’ve scouted the spots where "bar talk" is the norm and the music volume actually allows for conversation.</p>
    <ul class="gom-blog__list">
      <li><strong>DrYnk Bar & Lounge:</strong> A favorite for a reason. Their Happy Hour runs <strong>2 PM to 8 PM (Mon-Sat)</strong>, and the intimate layout (and strong pours) makes chatting with neighbors at the bar inevitable. It’s sophisticated but unpretentious.</li>
      <li><strong>Infinity Lounge:</strong> If you arrive a bit later, catch their happy hour until <strong>9 PM</strong>. It’s usually bustling with a slightly more local crowd who are happy to give recommendations to visitors.</li>
      <li><strong>Community Events:</strong> Check the calendar for <strong>Art Walk Wilton</strong> (every third Saturday) or events at The Pride Center. It’s a low-pressure way to mingle outside of a bar setting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="gom-blog__h3">The "Guesthouse Advantage"</h3>
    <p>Here’s the secret seasoned solo travelers know: staying at a big hotel often leads to isolation. Staying at a boutique guesthouse like <strong>Garden of Manors</strong> builds instant community.</p>
    <p>Our clothing-optional pool area acts as a natural social hub. It’s a judgment-free zone where you can chat with guys from all over the world while soaking up the sun. Many lifelong friendships (and repeat visits!) have started right here on our pool deck. Plus, knowing your hosts are just a text away gives you that extra layer of comfort.</p>

    <h3 class="gom-blog__h3">Safety Tips for Solo Guys</h3>
    <p>Wilton Manors is incredibly welcoming, but street smarts still apply. We want your trip to be memorable for the right reasons.</p>
    <ul class="gom-blog__list">
      <li><strong>Walk Smart:</strong> We are located about a <strong>20-minute walk (1 mile)</strong> from Wilton Drive. It’s a pleasant walk during the day, but at night, we always recommend a quick Uber or Lyft, especially if you’ve had a few drinks.</li>
      <li><strong>The "Safe Place" Program:</strong> Look for the rainbow "Safe Place" decal on businesses. The Wilton Manors Police Department partners with these venues to provide a safe haven if you ever feel harassed or unsafe.</li>
      <li><strong>Watch Your Drink:</strong> Valid everywhere, valid here. Keep an eye on your cocktail, even in the friendliest bars.</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="dining" class="gom-blog__section">
    <h3 class="gom-blog__h3">Dining for One</h3>
    <p>Table for one? Absolutely. These spots have excellent bar seating where you can eat a full meal without feeling conspicuous.</p>
    <ul class="gom-blog__list">
      <li><strong>Rosie's Bar & Grill:</strong> The Sunday Funday capital. Sit at the bar, order a burger, and you'll actaually be <em>surrounded</em> by conversation.</li>
      <li><strong>Ethos Greek Bistro:</strong> Great outdoor seating where people-watching is the main entertainment.</li>
      <li><strong>Gym Sportsbar:</strong> Perfect for grabbing wings and watching a game if you want a more casual, busy atmosphere.</li>
    </ul>

    <dl class="gom-faq">
      <dt>Is it safe to walk back to the Guesthouse at night?</dt>
      <dd>While the neighborhood is generally safe, we recommend a rideshare late at night for peace of mind. It's a quick 5-minute ride.</dd>
      <dt>Do you have events at the property?</dt>
      <dd>We focus on a relaxing atmosphere. We don't host raucous parties, which ensures you get a good night's sleep, but our pool area is always social during the day.</dd>
