    <h3 class="gom-blog__h3">More Than "No Clothes," It's "No Judgment"</h3>
    <p>For many, the idea of clothing-optional accommodation might sound intimidating at first. Is it a party? Is it awkward? At <strong>Garden of Manors</strong>, we redefine this concept. It's not about exhibitionism; it's about <strong>radical comfort</strong>.</p>

    <p>Imagine stepping out of your room, feeling the Florida sun directly on your skin, and diving into our saltwater pool without the barrier of wet swimwear. It's a feeling of primitive freedom we rarely experience in our daily lives.</p>

    <!-- STYLED QUOTE -->
    <blockquote class="quote-styled quote-green">
      "Here, it doesn't matter who you are, what you do, or what you look like. The moment you step into the garden, social labels disappear along with the clothes. It is the purest social leveler there is."

    <h3 class="gom-blog__h3">Benefits of a "Nude Detox"</h3>
    <p>Studies suggest that spending time nude can improve body image and self-esteem. Seeing real bodies, without Instagram filters, in a relaxed and respectful environment helps us reconcile with our own humanity.</p>

    <ul class="gom-blog__list">
      <li><strong>Full-Body Vitamin D:</strong> Soak up the sun (safely!) all over.</li>
      <li><strong>Thermal Regulation:</strong> Nothing beats the heat of Wilton Manors like a night swim exactly as nature intended.</li>
      <li><strong>Authentic Social Connection:</strong> Without designer labels or accessories signaling status, conversations tend to be more genuine and relaxed.</li>
