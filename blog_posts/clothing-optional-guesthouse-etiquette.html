    <h3 class="gom-blog__h3">Is "Clothing Optional" Required?</h3>
    <p><strong>Absolutely not.</strong> The keyword is <em>optional</em>. That means you are free to wear a swimsuit, shorts, a towel, or nothing at all—whatever makes you feel comfortable. There is no pressure to undress. Our goal at Garden of Manors is to create a sanctuary where body positivity rules and judgment is left at the door.</p>

    <h3 class="gom-blog__h3">The Golden Rules of Respect</h3>
    <p>To keep the vibe relaxing and private for everyone (guests, hosts, and neighbors), we follow a simple code of conduct:</p>
    <ul class="gom-blog__list">
      <li><strong>NO Photography:</strong> This is the #1 rule. Cameras and phones should be used with extreme discretion in common areas. Taking photos of other guests without their explicit consent is strictly prohibited. We value privacy above all else.</li>
      <li><strong>The Towel Rule:</strong> Hygiene matters. Always sit on a towel when using lounge chairs or patio furniture if you are enjoying the nudity. It’s simple courtesy.</li>
      <li><strong>Quiet Hours:</strong> We are a place of rest. Quiet hours are from <strong>10 PM to 8 AM</strong>. This ensures everyone can sleep peacefully after a night out.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent & Boundaries:</strong> We are a guesthouse, not a bathhouse. While we encourage social connection, all interactions must be consensual and respectful. "No" means no, and personal space should always be honored.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h3 class="gom-blog__h3">Common Areas vs. Private Rooms</h3>
    <p>Where does the policy apply?</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pool & Courtyard:</strong> Clothing is optional. Feel the sun on your skin!</li>
      <li><strong>The Driveway/Street:</strong> Clothing is <strong>mandatory</strong>. Wilton Manors is friendly, but public nudity laws still apply outside our gates.</li>
      <li><strong>Kitchen/Shared Indoor Spaces:</strong> We recommend a towel or shorts for hygiene while cooking or grabbing a coffee in shared indoor zones.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="gom-blog__h3">Why You Should Try It</h3>
    <p>There’s something incredibly liberating about swimming without a suit or reading a book by the pool with zero restrictions. It’s an ultimate form of relaxation that many of our "first-timer" guests end up loving. It fosters a sense of equality and natural confidence that you just don't get at a standard hotel.</p>
